You are a mechanical engineer in a multi-national company. Your boss has given a project to design a base plate with a list of requirements.
You are given a task to design a base plate according to the following requirements under the headings and subheadings 
underneath them starting from the token ```START``` and ends with the token ```END```. Please answer questions listed between tokens ```BEGIN``` and ```CLOSE``` followed by the requirements. If you are not confident enough to answer then you 
must not provide the answer, otherwise please provide anwers specific and concise manner according to the queries. If you want to assume any parameter which
might be missing here, you may assume accordingly. Please make output in HTML format with headers and subheaders with bullet points.

START

1. Load Capacity
	a. Primary Vertical Load: 3,000 N (≈ 300 kg mass-equivalent)
	b. Lateral (Horizontal) Load: 300 N (to simulate minor side loads/wind or a person leaning).
	c. The baseplate must safely carry these loads concurrently with Factor of Safety (FOS) ≥ 2.
2. Dimensions & Mounting
	a. Maximum Plate Footprint: 200 mm × 200 mm (students can design a shape within this envelope—square, rectangular, circular, etc.).
	b. Plate Thickness: Up to 10 mm max (to control weight and material usage).
	c. The baseplate must have four (4) mounting holes to accommodate M10 bolts (or equivalent fasteners).
	d. Mounting hole pattern (i.e., center-to-center spacing) should fit within the 200×200 mm footprint and be arranged to ensure stability.
3. Deflection Constraint
	a. Under the maximum expected load (vertical + lateral), the top surface of the baseplate should not deflect more than 0.5 mm at the center or post location.
4. Weight & Cost
	a. The baseplate should weigh no more than 3 kg to simplify handling.
	b. Aim for an estimated material cost ≤ $20 in moderate production volumes.
