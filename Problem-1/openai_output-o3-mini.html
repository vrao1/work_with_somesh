    <h2>4. CAD & FEA Models and Visual C++ Program</h2>
    <p>
      Providing full CAD/FEA model files is beyond the scope of a textual response. However, a high-level description and sample Visual C++ code outline are provided:
    </p>
    <h3>CAD & FEA Model Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop the 3D geometry (using software such as SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, or similar) that incorporates the plate profile and mounting holes.</li>
      <li>Apply boundary conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed support at the mounting hole positions.</li>
          <li>Apply vertical load of 3,000 N and lateral load of 300 N concurrently.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Analyze for stress, deflection, and factor of safety using an FEA solver (ANSYS, Abaqus, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Visual C++ Program Outline</h3>
    <p>The following sample code outlines a simple C++ structure that could be the basis for a simulation input pre-processor or data validator. Note: This is a simplified illustration; a full simulation tool would integrate with specialized libraries.</p>
    <pre>
/* 
   Simple Visual C++ Code Outline for Base Plate Parameter Checking 
   (Ensure to link with any required libraries if you extend functionality)
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct BasePlate {
    double length;      // in mm
    double width;       // in mm
    double thickness;   // in mm
    double verticalLoad; // in N
    double lateralLoad;  // in N
};

bool validateDesign(const BasePlate &plate) {
    // Check dimension requirements
    if(plate.length > 200 || plate.width > 200) {
        cout << "Error: Overall dimensions exceed maximum envelope." << endl;
        return false;
    }
    if(plate.thickness > 10) {
        cout << "Error: Thickness exceeds maximum limit." << endl;
        return false;
    }
    // Load Validation: Combined load must be within design limits with FOS >= 2
    // (Placeholder: Actual check would require material properties and stress analysis)
    if(plate.verticalLoad < 3000 || plate.lateralLoad < 300) {
        cout << "Error: Applied loads are below the required values." << endl;
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    BasePlate plate = {200, 200, 10, 3000, 300};
    if(validateDesign(plate)) {
        cout << "Base plate design meets the initial parameter requirements." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Base plate design validation failed. Please re-check the parameters." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
    </pre>
    
    <h2>5. Recommended Material(s)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy:</strong>

          <li>Employ simplified analytical approaches (e.g., equivalent beam theory) or full FEA for complex load distributions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Stress Analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify maximum bending stresses and compare them with the yield strength, incorporating a Factor of Safety of ≥2.</li>
          <li>Stress concentrations near the mounting holes must be evaluated and possibly reinforced or smoothed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7. Safety and Failure Analysis</h2>

        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>Material yielding due to excessive bending stresses.</li>
          <li>Local buckling or plastic deformation in regions with high stress concentration (e.g., around the mounting holes).</li>
          <li>Excessive deflection leading to functional or alignment issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
